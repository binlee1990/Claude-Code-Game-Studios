# Story 002: output is capped deterministically to 5 entries

## Context

**GDD**: `design/gdd/loot-system.md`
**Requirement**: `TR-loot-system-001` — LootSystem resolves weighted drops using DataConfig, ItemRegistry, EnemyDatabase, and the LOOT RNG stream.

**ADR Governing Implementation**: ADR-0005: 数据配置加载策略
**ADR Decision Summary**: Implement `DataConfig` as a `RefCounted` service held by an Autoload host. It scans JSON files under `res://assets/data/`, parses them with Godot JSON APIs, stores raw dictionaries in memory, and returns raw values to consumers. BigNumber conversion is performed by consumers according to their schemas.

**Engine**: Godot 4.6.2 | **Risk**: MEDIUM
**Engine Notes**: ADR-0005 status is Accepted; verify any Godot 4.6.2 behavior named by the ADR before closing the story.

**Control Manifest Rules (this layer)**:
- Required: **Use CombatCalculator as the single damage-resolution service for online and offline combat** — source: ADR-0009
- Required: **Use RNGManager COMBAT and LOOT streams consistently for combat and drops** — source: ADR-0004, ADR-0009
- Required: **Aggregate offline combat/reward facts into a draft before settlement** — source: ADR-0009, ADR-0015
- Required: **Use OutputMultiplierSystem/ModifierEngine for production multipliers; ResourceSystem only receives settled amounts** — source: ADR-0007, ADR-0010
- Forbidden: **Never duplicate combat damage formulas inside OfflineCombatSimulation** — source: ADR-0009
- Forbidden: **Never let OfflineCombatSimulation call SemiAutoCombatSystem directly** — source: ADR-0009
- Forbidden: **Never let feature systems write resources by bypassing ResourceSystem APIs** — source: ADR-0010
- Guardrail: **Offline simulation**: chunk long deltas and profile before vertical slice — source: ADR-0015
- Guardrail: **Combat/offline equivalence**: fixed-seed online/offline replay tests are mandatory before Pre-Production prototype confidence — source: ADR-0009, ADR-0015

## Acceptance Criteria

*From GDD `design/gdd/loot-system.md`, scoped to this story:*

- [x] GIVEN: max drops per kill is 5, **WHEN** table has 20 successful entries, **THEN** output is capped deterministically to 5 entries.
- [x] GIVEN: bundle has any reward, **WHEN** roll completes, **THEN** one `loot.dropped` event is emitted.

---

## Implementation Notes

*Derived from ADR-0005 Implementation Guidelines:*

- Must use JSON files in `res://assets/data/` for MVP configuration.
- Must not use Godot Resource files as the MVP content format.
- Must keep DataConfig schema-agnostic; consumers parse BigNumber strings themselves.
- Must keep all loaded tables in memory for MVP.
- Must allow one failed table to degrade to an empty table without stopping other tables.
- Must restrict `reload_table` and `reload_all` to debug builds.

## Out of Scope

- Story 001 covers the baseline contract for this epic; do not duplicate its setup work here.

## QA Test Cases

*Written at story creation. The developer implements against these cases.*

- **AC**: GIVEN: max drops per kill is 5, **WHEN** table has 20 successful entries, **THEN** output is capped deterministically to 5 entries.
  - Given: max drops per kill is 5
  - When: table has 20 successful entries
  - Then: output is capped deterministically to 5 entries
  - Edge cases: boundary, invalid, missing-data, and repeat-run variants from the GDD edge-case section

- **AC**: GIVEN: bundle has any reward, **WHEN** roll completes, **THEN** one `loot.dropped` event is emitted.
